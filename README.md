# Blog
Here is the code from my blog
I show how to do different things on my blog - things I have learnt to do on my data science journey and I display the code from it here. <br> <br>

I mainly used Python (and pandas module)
You can learn how to deal with missing values, duplicate values, perform basic statistics and many other operations like choose particular columns or rows in your DataFrame.
